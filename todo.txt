* all the testing stuff I have done needs one step beforehand
  - the files have to be moved to a dist, because the static files need to be in "public"
* fix first.spec.js to go against angular site (just ref angular from bower_components)
* work out directory structure for deployed app
* determine location of js files to be deployed.
    - some kind of config file to map stuff over?
    - what is the file movement thing I have used?
    - is there a way to have the view programmatically pick?
        - no. performance as the final will be deployed.
        - file needs to be processed before inclusion
        - maybe a config that is separated by env
        - there I might be able to refactor stuff away
        - driving this by a separate config
        - then I would just need to edit the separate config as I change stuff
            -- how about views like: index.dev.html and index.prod.html ??

* cucumber/protractor??
* work from outside in

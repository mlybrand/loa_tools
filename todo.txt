* controller
  - main controller -> /
    - purpose of main controller is just to marshal users to other controllers based on state
    - anonymous / splash not dismissed -> splash
    - anonymous / splash dismissed -> info
    - authenticated -> dash
    - initially, I will only have main direct to splash since the state maintenance probably needs to be a service


  - splash -> /splash
  - info -> /info
  - dash -> /dash

* I need to think about what kind of client side routing I want

* set up google analytics
* look for logging strategies

* work from outside in
